# CentOS WSL2

## Enabling WSL2

1. Enable WSL

   ```
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
   ```

2. Enable Virtual Machine Platform feature

   Required for WSL2.

   ```
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
   ```

3. Set default WSL version

   (Optional)
   
   ```
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

## Import CentOS image

1. Download latest image named `CentOS-8-Container-8*.x86_64.tar.xz` from [http://cloud.centos.org/centos/8/x86_64/images/](http://cloud.centos.org/centos/8/x86_64/images/).

2. Extract `layer.tar` file from the downloaded archive.

3. Import the image

   ```
   wsl --import centos8 opt\wsl\centos8 layer.tar --version 2
   ```

   The first argument `centos8` is name that will be later used to reference this distribution.

   The second argument `opt\wsl\centos8` is path to a directory (it may not exist, the parent directory must) where the distribution will be installed in.

   The third argument `layer.tar` is path to the extracted system image.

   Import can be verified by listing all available distributions:

   ```
   PS > wsl -l -v
   NAME            STATE           VERSION
   centos8         Stopped         2
   ```

## Running the distribution

```
wsl -d centos8
```

The `centos8` is distribution name used when importing the image.

Provided a distribution is marked as default by 

```
wsl --set-default centos8
```

it can be later invoked just by

```
wsl
```

## Custom user

The image doesn't define any extra users so bash will start under root user. If you create your own user, WSL can be configured to be start using this user - see guide [Add your user](https://fedoramagazine.org/wsl-fedora-33/) part of Using Fedora 33 with Microsoftâ€™s WSL2 article.
